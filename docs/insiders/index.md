# Insiders

Material for MkDocs follows the _sponsorware_ release strategy, which means
that _new features are first exclusively released to sponsors_ as part of
__Insiders__. Read on to learn [how sponsorship works][1], and how easy it is
to [get access to Insiders][2].


## How sponsorship works

New features first land in Insiders, so _eligible sponsors have immediate
access_. Every feature is tied to a funding goal in monthly subscriptions.
When a funding goal is hit, the features that are tied to it are merged back
into Material for MkDocs and released for general availability. Bugfixes are
always released simultaneously in both editions.[^1]

  [^1]:
    You may ask yourself why you should pay for something that is Open Source.
    Doesn't that contradict the ethos of Open Source software? Yes and no. Yes,
    some features are locked behind a monthly subscription, which means they are
    only accessible when paying a small amount of money. No, the features are
    only exclusive for a short time until specific funding goals are hit. Making
    an Open Source project sustainable is exceptionally hard: maintainers burn
    out, projects are abandoned. That's not great and very unpredictable. The
    sponsorware model ensures that if you decide to use Material for MkDocs,
    you can be sure that bugs are fixed quickly and new features are added
    regularly.

_Don't want to sponsor? No problem, Material for MkDocs already has tons of
features available, so chances are that most of your requirements are already
satisfied. See the [list of exclusive features][4] to learn which features are
currently only available to sponsors._
